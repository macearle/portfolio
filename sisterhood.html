				<h3>Big Little</h3>
				<p id="heights">In AXO, we have a tradition of a mentorship program that is called Big Little. Essentially, a few months after a new class of members join our sorority, 
					we have a month where these new members get to know the members a year older than them. After various activities in both group and one on one settings, there is a 
					Big Little reveal week. This is when older members create baskets with AXO merchandise, and all of their little's favorite things. At the end of this week,
					we have a reveal celebration for the bigs and littles to spend time together. A member's big serves as her mentor for the rest of their time in AXO. The new members 
					also get the opportunity to have close relationships with members of all grades, as they spend time with their entire lineage. Their bigs and grand bigs lead them 
					through Initiation, and with any struggle they are facing. Your big is a built in big sister!</p>

				<h3>Game Days</h3>
				<p id="heights">Saturday's during the fall are some of our favorite days of the year! We love to spend time with our sisters at tailgates before football games, 
					along with walking in big groups to the game together, and sitting together in the student section to cheer on the team. We also love to trade our gameday outfits 
				and show our school spirit with fun Michigan clothes!</p>

				<h3>Other Bonding Events</h3>
				<p id="heights">Throughout the school year, we have many other various events for our sisters to get to know each other. From organized events such as trips up north during fall break,
					or visiting the county fair, to spur of the moment bonding time like getting ready in the house together, or going on walks. Pictured below is also one of our favorite days of wonter semester,
					bid day! Bid day is when we welcome our new freshman member class, and every member of every grade is at the house to celebrate as our new members run home!
