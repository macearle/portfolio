        <p id = "heights">At Alpha Chi Omega, we pride ourselves in upholding a high standard to all of our members for both promoting 
            and educating on the efforts of Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion. Our DEI committee consists of our VP of DEI, 
            who is a member of our executive board, and 3 representatives from each grade. Creating a space where our members feel
            included, safe, and validated is extremely important to us. </p>

    <img id = "deiimage" src = "images/dragbrunch.png" alt= "drag brunch photo at 1212" width="400"/>
  
        <p id= "heights">Every month the DEI team hosts an event called "Real Talk," where members can submit anonymous questions or concerns relating to diversity, equity, and inclusion, and the team will openly answer them and offer advice.
        Additionally, the DEI team plans events for out chapter to come together to further our education. For example, we rented out the State St. Theater and watched the movie Just Mercy. 
        We also held a brunch with a drag show at our house, which is pictured above. 
        Overall, as a chapter, we continue to strive to be an inclusive space and educate ourselves on the various issues relating to diversity, equity, and inclusion.
